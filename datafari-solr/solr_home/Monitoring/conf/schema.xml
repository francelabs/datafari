<!-- This is the Solr schema file. This file should be named "schema.xml" and should be in the conf directory under the solr home (i.e. ./solr/conf/schema.xml by default) or located where the classloader 
  for the Solr webapp can find it. This example schema is the recommended starting point for users. It should be kept correct and concise, usable out-of-the-box. For more information, on how to customize 
  this file, please see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml PERFORMANCE NOTE: this schema includes many optional features and should not be used for benchmarking. To improve performance one could - set 
  stored="false" for all fields possible (esp large fields) when you only need to search on the field but don't need to return the original value. - set indexed="false" if you don't need to search on the 
  field, but only return the field as a result of searching on other indexed fields. - remove all unneeded copyField statements - for best index size and searching performance, set "index" to false for all 
  general text fields, use copyField to copy them to the catchall "text" field, and use that for searching. - For maximum indexing performance, use the StreamingUpdateSolrServer java client. - Remember to 
  run the JVM in server mode, and use a higher logging level that avoids logging every request -->
