       All directories and paths are resolved relative to the
       instanceDir.

       Please note that <lib/> directives are processed in the order
       that they appear in your solrconfig.xml file, and are "stacked" 
       on top of each other when building a ClassLoader - so if you have 
       plugin jars with dependencies on other jars, the "lower level" 
       dependency jars should be loaded first.

       If a "./lib" directory exists in your instanceDir, all files
       found in it are included as if you had used the following
       syntax...

       for better NRT performance.

  <!-- The CodecFactory for defining the format of the inverted index.
       The default implementation is SchemaCodecFactory, which is the official Lucene
       index format, but hooks into the schema to provide per-field customization of
       the postings lists and per-document values in the fieldType element
       (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
       are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, its a good
       idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
       before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.

         <str name="managedSchemaResourceName">managed-schema</str>

       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified, Solr will load the schema from
       he resource named in 'managedSchemaResourceName', rather than from schema.xml.
       Note that the managed schema resource CANNOT be named schema.xml.  If the managed
       schema does not exist, Solr will create it after reading schema.xml, then rename
       'schema.xml' to 'schema.xml.bak'. 
       
       Do NOT hand edit the managed schema - external modifications will be ignored and
       overwritten as a result of schema modification REST API calls.

       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified with mutable = true, schema
       modification REST API calls will be allowed; otherwise, error responses will be
       sent back for these requests.

        Various IndexSearcher related events can trigger Listeners to

        newSearcher - fired whenever a new searcher is being prepared
        and there is a current searcher handling requests (aka
        registered).  It can be used to prime certain caches to
        prevent long request times for certain requests.

        firstSearcher - fired whenever a new searcher is being
        prepared but there is no current registered searcher to handle
        requests or to gain autowarming data from.

    <!-- Use Cold Searcher

         If a search request comes in and there is no current
         registered searcher, then immediately register the still
         warming searcher and use it.  If "false" then all requests
         will block until the first searcher is done warming.

  <!-- Request Dispatcher

       This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter
       should behave when processing requests for this SolrCore.

       handleSelect is a legacy option that affects the behavior of requests
       such as /select?qt=XXX

       handleSelect="true" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to process
       the request and dispatch the query to a handler specified by the 
       "qt" param, assuming "/select" isn't already registered.

       handleSelect="false" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to
       ignore "/select" requests, resulting in a 404 unless a handler
       is explicitly registered with the name "/select"

       handleSelect="true" is not recommended for new users, but is the default
       for backwards compatibility
    -->
  <requestDispatcher handleSelect="false">
    <!-- Request Parsing

         These settings indicate how Solr Requests may be parsed, and
         what restrictions may be placed on the ContentStreams from
         those requests

         enableRemoteStreaming - enables use of the stream.file
         and stream.url parameters for specifying remote streams.

         multipartUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         Multipart File Uploads that Solr will allow in a Request.
         
         formdataUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) sent via
         POST. You can use POST to pass request parameters not
         fitting into the URL.
         
         addHttpRequestToContext - if set to true, it will instruct
         the requestParsers to include the original HttpServletRequest
         object in the context map of the SolrQueryRequest under the 
         key "httpRequest". It will not be used by any of the existing
         Solr components, but may be useful when developing custom 
         plugins.
         
         *** WARNING ***
         The settings below authorize Solr to fetch remote files, You
         should make sure your system has some authentication before
         using enableRemoteStreaming="true"

      --> 
    <requestParsers addHttpRequestToContext="false" enableRemoteStreaming="true" formdataUploadLimitInKB="2048" multipartUploadLimitInKB="2048000"/>

    <!-- HTTP Caching

         Set HTTP caching related parameters (for proxy caches and clients).

         The options below instruct Solr not to output any HTTP Caching
         related headers
      -->
    <httpCaching never304="true"/>
 
  </requestDispatcher>

  <!-- Request Handlers 

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRequestHandler

       Incoming queries will be dispatched to a specific handler by name
       based on the path specified in the request.

       Legacy behavior: If the request path uses "/select" but no Request
       Handler has that name, and if handleSelect="true" has been specified in
       the requestDispatcher, then the Request Handler is dispatched based on
       the qt parameter.  Handlers without a leading '/' are accessed this way
       like so: http://host/app/[core/]select?qt=name  If no qt is
       given, then the requestHandler that declares default="true" will be
       used or the one named "standard".

       If a Request Handler is declared with startup="lazy", then it will
       not be initialized until the first request that uses it.

  <!-- Field Analysis Request Handler

       RequestHandler that provides much the same functionality as
       analysis.jsp. Provides the ability to specify multiple field
       types and field names in the same request and outputs
       index-time and query-time analysis for each of them.

       Request parameters are:
       analysis.fieldname - field name whose analyzers are to be used

       analysis.fieldtype - field type whose analyzers are to be used
       analysis.fieldvalue - text for index-time analysis
       q (or analysis.q) - text for query time analysis
       analysis.showmatch (true|false) - When set to true and when
           query analysis is performed, the produced tokens of the
           field value analysis will be marked as "matched" for every
           token that is produces by the query analysis
   -->
  <requestHandler class="solr.FieldAnalysisRequestHandler" name="/analysis/field" startup="lazy"/>


  <!-- Document Analysis Handler

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalysisRequestHandler

       An analysis handler that provides a breakdown of the analysis
       process of provided documents. This handler expects a (single)
       content stream with the following format:

       <docs>
         <doc>
           <field name="id">1</field>
           <field name="name">The Name</field>
           <field name="text">The Text Value</field>
         </doc>
         <doc>...</doc>
         <doc>...</doc>
         ...
       </docs>

    Note: Each document must contain a field which serves as the
    unique key. This key is used in the returned response to associate
    an analysis breakdown to the analyzed document.

    Like the FieldAnalysisRequestHandler, this handler also supports
    query analysis by sending either an "analysis.query" or "q"
    request parameter that holds the query text to be analyzed. It
    also supports the "analysis.showmatch" parameter which when set to
    true, all field tokens that match the query tokens will be marked
    as a "match".

       <int name="connection">jdbc://....</int>
     </transformer>
     
     To add a constant value to all docs, use:
     <transformer name="mytrans2" class="org.apache.solr.response.transform.ValueAugmenterFactory" >
       <int name="value">5</int>
     </transformer>
     
     If you want the user to still be able to change it with _value:something_ use this:
     <transformer name="mytrans3" class="org.apache.solr.response.transform.ValueAugmenterFactory" >
       <double name="defaultValue">5</double>
     </transformer>

      If you are using the QueryElevationComponent, you may wish to mark documents that get boosted.  The
      EditorialMarkerFactory will do exactly that:
     <transformer name="qecBooster" class="org.apache.solr.response.transform.EditorialMarkerFactory" />
