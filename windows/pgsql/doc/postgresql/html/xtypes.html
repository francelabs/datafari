  A user-defined type must always have input and output functions.
  These functions determine how the type appears in strings (for input
  by the user and output to the user) and how the type is organized in
  memory.  The input function takes a null-terminated character string
  as its argument and returns the internal (in memory) representation
  of the type.  The output function takes the internal representation
  of the type as argument and returns a null-terminated character
  string.  If we want to do anything more with the type than merely
  store it, we must provide additional functions to implement whatever
  operations we'd like to have for the type.
 </P
><P
>  Suppose we want to define a type <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>complex</TT
> that represents
  complex numbers. A natural way to represent a complex number in
  memory would be the following C structure:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>typedef struct Complex {
    double      x;
    double      y;
} Complex;</PRE
><P>

  We will need to make this a pass-by-reference type, since it's too
  large to fit into a single <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>Datum</TT
> value.
 </P
><P
>  As the external string representation of the type, we choose a
  string of the form <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>(x,y)</TT
>.
 </P
><P
>  The input and output functions are usually not hard to write,
  especially the output function.  But when defining the external
  string representation of the type, remember that you must eventually
  write a complete and robust parser for that representation as your
  input function.  For instance:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(complex_in);

Datum
complex_in(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    char       *str = PG_GETARG_CSTRING(0);
    double      x,
                y;
    Complex    *result;

    if (sscanf(str, " ( %lf , %lf )", &#38;x, &#38;y) != 2)
        ereport(ERROR,
                (errcode(ERRCODE_INVALID_TEXT_REPRESENTATION),
                 errmsg("invalid input syntax for complex: \"%s\"",
                        str)));

    result = (Complex *) palloc(sizeof(Complex));
    result-&#62;x = x;
    result-&#62;y = y;
    PG_RETURN_POINTER(result);
}</PRE
><P>

  The output function can simply be:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(complex_out);

Datum
complex_out(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    Complex    *complex = (Complex *) PG_GETARG_POINTER(0);
    char       *result;

    result = (char *) palloc(100);
    snprintf(result, 100, "(%g,%g)", complex-&#62;x, complex-&#62;y);
    PG_RETURN_CSTRING(result);
}</PRE
><P>
 </P
><P
>  You should be careful to make the input and output functions inverses of
  each other.  If you do not, you will have severe problems when you
  need to dump your data into a file and then read it back in.  This
  is a particularly common problem when floating-point numbers are
  involved.
 </P
><P
>  Optionally, a user-defined type can provide binary input and output
  routines.  Binary I/O is normally faster but less portable than textual
  I/O.  As with textual I/O, it is up to you to define exactly what the
  external binary representation is.  Most of the built-in data types
  try to provide a machine-independent binary representation.  For
  <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>complex</TT
>, we will piggy-back on the binary I/O converters
  for type <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>float8</TT
>:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(complex_recv);

Datum
complex_recv(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    StringInfo  buf = (StringInfo) PG_GETARG_POINTER(0);
    Complex    *result;

    result = (Complex *) palloc(sizeof(Complex));
    result-&#62;x = pq_getmsgfloat8(buf);
    result-&#62;y = pq_getmsgfloat8(buf);
    PG_RETURN_POINTER(result);
}

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(complex_send);

Datum
complex_send(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    Complex    *complex = (Complex *) PG_GETARG_POINTER(0);
    StringInfoData buf;

    pq_begintypsend(&#38;buf);

}</PRE
><P>
 </P
><P
>  Once we have written the I/O functions and compiled them into a shared
  library, we can define the <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>complex</TT
> type in SQL.
  First we declare it as a shell type:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TYPE complex;</PRE
><P>

  This serves as a placeholder that allows us to reference the type while
  defining its I/O functions.  Now we can define the I/O functions:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE FUNCTION complex_in(cstring)
    RETURNS complex
    AS '<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>filename</I
></TT
>'
    LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

CREATE FUNCTION complex_out(complex)
    RETURNS cstring
    AS '<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>filename</I
></TT
>'
    LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

CREATE FUNCTION complex_recv(internal)
   RETURNS complex
   AS '<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>filename</I
></TT
>'
   LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

CREATE FUNCTION complex_send(complex)
   RETURNS bytea
   AS '<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>filename</I
></TT
>'
   LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;</PRE
><P>
 </P
><P
>  Finally, we can provide the full definition of the data type:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TYPE complex (
   internallength = 16,
   input = complex_in,
   output = complex_out,
   receive = complex_recv,
   send = complex_send,
   alignment = double
);</PRE
><P>
 </P
><P
>  
  When you define a new base type,
  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> automatically provides support
  for arrays of that type.  The array type typically
  has the same name as the base type with the underscore character
  (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>_</TT
>) prepended.
 </P
><P
>  Once the data type exists, we can declare additional functions to
  provide useful operations on the data type.  Operators can then be
  defined atop the functions, and if needed, operator classes can be
  created to support indexing of the data type.  These additional
  layers are discussed in following sections.
 </P
><P
>   
  If the values of your data type vary in size (in internal form), you should
  make the data type <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
>-able (see <A
HREF="storage-toast.html"
>Section 58.2</A
>). You should do this even if the data are always
  too small to be compressed or stored externally, because
  <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TOAST</ACRONYM
> can save space on small data too, by reducing header
  overhead.
 </P
><P
>  To do this, the internal representation must follow the standard layout for
  variable-length data: the first four bytes must be a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>char[4]</TT
>
  field which is never accessed directly (customarily named
  <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>vl_len_</TT
>). You
  must use <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>SET_VARSIZE()</CODE
> to store the size of the datum
  in this field and <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>VARSIZE()</CODE
> to retrieve it. The C
  functions operating on the data type must always be careful to unpack any
  toasted values they are handed, by using <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PG_DETOAST_DATUM</CODE
>.
  (This detail is customarily hidden by defining type-specific
  <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GETARG_DATATYPE_P</CODE
> macros.) Then, when running the
  <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE TYPE</TT
> command, specify the internal length as
  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>variable</TT
> and select the appropriate storage option.
 </P
><P
>  If the alignment is unimportant (either just for a specific function or
  because the data type specifies byte alignment anyway) then it's possible
  to avoid some of the overhead of <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PG_DETOAST_DATUM</CODE
>. You can use
  <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PG_DETOAST_DATUM_PACKED</CODE
> instead (customarily hidden by
  defining a <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>GETARG_DATATYPE_PP</CODE
> macro) and using the macros
  <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>VARSIZE_ANY_EXHDR</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>VARDATA_ANY</CODE
> to access
  a potentially-packed datum.
  Again, the data returned by these macros is not aligned even if the data
  type definition specifies an alignment. If the alignment is important you
  must go through the regular <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PG_DETOAST_DATUM</CODE
> interface.

>Note: </B

   working with a potentially unaligned datum; the compiler may take it as
   license to assume the datum actually is aligned, leading to core dumps on
   architectures that are strict about alignment.
