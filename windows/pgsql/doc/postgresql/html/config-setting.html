><P
>     One way to set these parameters is to edit the file
     <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
>,
     which is normally kept in the data directory.  (A default copy is
     installed there when the database cluster directory is
     initialized.)  An example of what this file might look like is:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
># This is a comment
log_connections = yes
log_destination = 'syslog'
search_path = '"$user", public'
shared_buffers = 128MB</PRE
><P>
     One parameter is specified per line. The equal sign between name and
     value is optional. Whitespace is insignificant and blank lines are
     ignored. Hash marks (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#</TT
>) designate the remainder of the
     line as a comment.  Parameter values that are not simple identifiers or
     numbers must be single-quoted.  To embed a single quote in a parameter
     value, write either two quotes (preferred) or backslash-quote.
    </P
><P
>     
     The configuration file is reread whenever the main server process
     receives a <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>SIGHUP</SPAN
> signal;  this is most easily done by
     running <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_ctl reload</TT
> from the command-line or by calling
     the SQL function <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_reload_conf()</CODE
>. The main
     server process
     also propagates this signal to all currently running server
     processes so that existing sessions also get the new
     value. Alternatively, you can send the signal to a single server
     process directly.  Some parameters can only be set at server start;
     any changes to their entries in the configuration file will be ignored
     until the server is restarted.  Invalid parameter settings in the
     configuration file are likewise ignored (but logged) during
     <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>SIGHUP</SPAN
> processing.

     as a command-line option to the <TT

     such as:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>postgres -c log_connections=yes -c log_destination='syslog'</PRE
><P>
     Command-line options override any conflicting settings in
     <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
>.  Note that this means you won't
     be able to change the value on-the-fly by editing
     <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
>, so while the command-line
     method might be convenient, it can cost you flexibility later.
    </P
><P
>     Occasionally it is useful to give a command line option to
     one particular session only. The environment variable
     <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGOPTIONS</TT
> can be used for this purpose on the
     client side:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>env PGOPTIONS='-c geqo=off' psql</PRE
><P>
     (This works for any <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libpq</SPAN
>-based client application, not
     just <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
>.) Note that this won't work for
     parameters that are fixed when the server is started or that must be
     specified in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
>.
    </P
><P
>     Furthermore, it is possible to assign a set of parameter settings to
     a user or a database.  Whenever a session is started, the default
     settings for the user and database involved are loaded.  The
     commands <A
HREF="sql-alterrole.html"
>ALTER ROLE</A
>
     and <A
HREF="sql-alterdatabase.html"
>ALTER DATABASE</A
>,
     respectively, are used to configure these settings.  Per-database
     settings override anything received from the
     <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postgres</TT
> command-line or the configuration
     file, and in turn are overridden by per-user settings; both are
     overridden by per-session settings.
    </P
><P
>     Some parameters can be changed in individual <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
>
     sessions with the <A
HREF="sql-set.html"
>SET</A
>
     command, for example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>SET ENABLE_SEQSCAN TO OFF;</PRE
><P>
     If <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SET</TT
> is allowed, it overrides all other sources of
     values for the parameter. Some parameters cannot be changed via
     <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SET</TT
>: for example, if they control behavior that
     cannot be changed without restarting the entire
     <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> server.  Also, some parameters
     require superuser permission to change via <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SET</TT

     <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER</TT

         In addition to parameter settings, the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
>
         file can contain <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>include directives</I
>, which specify
         another file to read and process as if it were inserted into the
         configuration file at this point.  This feature allows a configuration
         file to be divided into physically separate parts.
         Include directives simply look like:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>include 'filename'</PRE
><P>
         If the file name is not an absolute path, it is taken as relative to
         the directory containing the referencing configuration file.
         Inclusions can be nested.
     </P
><P
>      
         There is also an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>include_if_exists</TT
> directive, which acts
         the same as the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>include</TT
> directive, except for the behavior
         when the referenced file does not exist or cannot be read.  A regular
         <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>include</TT
> will consider this an error condition, but
         <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>include_if_exists</TT
> merely logs a message and continues
         processing the referencing configuration file.
     </P
><P
>      
        The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> file can also contain
        <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>include_dir</TT
> directives, which specify an entire directory
        of configuration files to include.  It is used similarly:
 </P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
> include_dir 'directory'
 </PRE
><P>
        Non-absolute directory names follow the same rules as single file include
        directives:  they are relative to the directory containing the referencing
        configuration file.  Within that directory, only non-directory files whose
        names end with the suffix <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.conf</TT
> will be included.  File
        names that start with the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.</TT
> character are also excluded,
        to prevent mistakes as they are hidden on some platforms.  Multiple files
        within an include directory are processed in file name order. The file names
        are ordered by C locale rules, ie. numbers before letters, and uppercase
        letters before lowercase ones.
     </P
><P
>       Include files or directories can be used to logically separate portions
       of the database configuration, rather than having a single large
       <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> file.  Consider a company that has two
       database servers, each with a different amount of memory.  There are likely
       elements of the configuration both will share, for things such as logging.
       But memory-related parameters on the server will vary between the two.  And
       there might be server specific customizations, too.  One way to manage this
       situation is to break the custom configuration changes for your site into
       three files.  You could add this to the end of your
       <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> file to include them:
 </P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
> include 'shared.conf'
 include 'memory.conf'
 include 'server.conf'
 </PRE
><P>
       All systems would have the same <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>shared.conf</TT
>.  Each server
       with a particular amount of memory could share the same
       <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>memory.conf</TT
>; you might have one for all servers with 8GB of RAM,
       another for those having 16GB.  And finally <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>server.conf</TT
> could
       have truly server-specific configuration information in it.
     </P
><P
>       Another possibility is to create a configuration file directory and
       put this information into files there. For example, a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>conf.d</TT
>
       directory could be referenced at the end of<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
>:
 </P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
> include_dir 'conf.d'
 </PRE
><P>
       Then you could name the files in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>conf.d</TT
> directory like this:
 </P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
> 00shared.conf
 01memory.conf
 02server.conf
 </PRE
><P>
       This shows a clear order in which these files will be loaded.  This is
       important because only the last setting encountered when the server is
       reading its configuration will be used.  Something set in
       <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>conf.d/02server.conf</TT
> in this example would override a value
       set in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>conf.d/01memory.conf</TT
>.
     </P
><P
>       You might instead use this configuration directory approach while naming
       these files more descriptively:
 </P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
> 00shared.conf
 01memory-8GB.conf
 02server-foo.conf
 </PRE
><P>
       This sort of arrangement gives a unique name for each configuration file
       variation.  This can help eliminate ambiguity when several servers have
       their configurations all stored in one place, such as in a version
       control repository.  (Storing database configuration files under version
       control is another good practice to consider).
