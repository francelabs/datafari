        a page write that is in process during an operating system crash might

        guarantees that the page can be correctly restored, but at the price
        of increasing the amount of data that must be written to WAL.
        (Because WAL replay always starts from a checkpoint, it is sufficient
        to do this during the first change of each page after a checkpoint.
        Therefore, one way to reduce the cost of full-page writes is to
        increase the checkpoint interval parameters.)

>        The <A
HREF="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-COMMAND"
>archive_command</A
> is only invoked for
        completed WAL segments. Hence, if your server generates little WAL
        traffic (or has slack periods where it does so), there could be a
        long delay between the completion of a transaction and its safe
        recording in archive storage.  To limit how old unarchived
        data can be, you can set <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>archive_timeout</TT
> to force the
        server to switch to a new WAL segment file periodically.  When this
        parameter is greater than zero, the server will switch to a new
        segment file whenever this many seconds have elapsed since the last
        segment file switch, and there has been any database activity,
        including a single checkpoint.  (Increasing
        <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_timeout</TT
> will reduce unnecessary
        checkpoints on an idle system.)
        Note that archived files that are closed early
        due to a forced switch are still the same length as completely full
        files.  Therefore, it is unwise to use a very short
        <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>archive_timeout</TT
> &mdash; it will bloat your archive
        storage.  <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>archive_timeout</TT
> settings of a minute or so are
        usually reasonable.  You should consider using streaming replication,
        instead of archiving, if you want data to be copied off the master
        server more quickly than that.
        This parameter can only be set in the
