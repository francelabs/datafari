     Begin executing a foreign scan. This is called during executor startup.
     It should perform any initialization needed before the scan can start,
     but not start executing the actual scan (that should be done upon the
     first call to <CODE

     The <TT

     <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"

     Fetch one row from the foreign source, returning it in a tuple table slot
     (the node's <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>ScanTupleSlot</TT
> should be used for this
     purpose).  Return NULL if no more rows are available.  The tuple table
     slot infrastructure allows either a physical or virtual tuple to be
     returned; in most cases the latter choice is preferable from a
     performance standpoint.  Note that this is called in a short-lived memory
     context that will be reset between invocations.  Create a memory context
     in <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>BeginForeignScan</CODE
> if you need longer-lived storage, or use
     the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>es_query_cxt</TT

CLASS="STRUCTNAME"

    </P

     being scanned.  If you choose to optimize away fetching columns that
     are not needed, you should insert nulls in those column positions.
    </P

     whether the rows returned violate any <TT

     constraints that were defined on the foreign table columns &mdash; but
     the planner does care, and may optimize queries incorrectly if
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
> values are present in a column declared not to contain
     them.  If a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
> value is encountered when the user has
     declared that none should be present, it may be appropriate to raise an
     error (just as you would need to do in the case of a data type mismatch).
    </P
><P

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>void
ReScanForeignScan (ForeignScanState *node);</PRE
><P>

     Restart the scan from the beginning.  Note that any parameters the
     scan depends on may have changed value, so the new scan does not
     necessarily return exactly the same rows.
    </P
><P
></P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>void
EndForeignScan (ForeignScanState *node);</PRE
><P>

     End the scan and release resources.  It is normally not important
     to release palloc'd memory, but for example open files and connections
     to remote servers should be cleaned up.
