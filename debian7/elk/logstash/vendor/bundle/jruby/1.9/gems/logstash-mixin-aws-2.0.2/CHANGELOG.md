## 2.0.0
 - Plugins were updated to follow the new shutdown semantic, this mainly allows Logstash to instruct input plugins to terminate gracefully, 
   instead of using Thread.raise on the plugins' threads. Ref: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/3895
 - Dependency on logstash-core update to 2.0

# 1.0.1
  * Correctly set proxy options on V2 of the aws-sdk

# 1.0.0
