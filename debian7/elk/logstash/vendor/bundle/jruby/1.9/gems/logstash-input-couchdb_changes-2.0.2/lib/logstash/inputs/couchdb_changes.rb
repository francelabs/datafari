# This CouchDB input allows you to automatically stream events from the
# CouchDB http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/notifications.html[_changes] URI.
# Moreover, any "future" changes will automatically be streamed as well making it easy to synchronize
# your CouchDB data with any target destination
#
# ### Upsert and delete
# You can use event metadata to allow for document deletion.
# All non-delete operations are treated as upserts
#
# ### Starting at a Specific Sequence
# The CouchDB input stores the last sequence number value in location defined by `sequence_path`.
# You can use this fact to start or resume the stream at a particular sequence.
