      # @option options [Float] :long The longitude to search around. The valid range for longitude is -180.0 to +180.0 (East is positive) inclusive. This option will be ignored if outside that range, if it is not a number, if geo_enabled is disabled, or if there not a corresponding :lat option.

This does not guarantee that the number of results returned will equal max_results, but instead informs how many "nearby" results to return. Ideally, only pass in the number of places you intend to display to the user here.
