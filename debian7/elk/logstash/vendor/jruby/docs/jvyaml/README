= RbYAML - A pure Ruby YAML 1.1 loader and dumper

Project Contact: Ola Bini <ola@ologix.com>

The code is based mostly on the Python code written by Kirill Simonov <xi@resolvent.net> for PyYAML3000.

RbYAML is a project originating in the JRuby project (http://jruby.sourceforge.net), to create a pure Ruby
YAML parser for use in JRuby and SYCK cannot be used in this case. 
Since the effort of writing a new one from scratch seemed like a major undertaking it seemed easier to
port an existing one. 

The current functionality is more or less 1.1-compliant. What's missing is the Unicode-support. The idea
is to have the interface resemble SYCK as much as possible, but this is still work in progress, since some
of the major architectural choices are quite different.

== Use

Just require 'rbyaml' and use it as you would use YAML, but in module RbYAML instead:
   
        require 'rbyaml'
        
        RbYAML.load("--- \n- A\n- b\n- c\n")       ---->   ["A","b","c"]
        "foo".to_yaml                              ---->   "foo\n"
