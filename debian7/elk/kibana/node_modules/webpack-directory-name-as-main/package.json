  "readme": "# webpack-directory-name-as-main\n\nTeach webpack to use a file with the same name as the directory if that directory is required and it doesn't have an index.js file.\n\nThis allows you to write:\n\n`require('lib/ReallyImportantModule')`\n\ninorder to require:\n\n`lib/ReallyImportantModule/ReallyImportantModule.js`\n\n\nThis module is designed to be used as strategy for a `webpack.ResolverPlugin` like so:\n```js\nvar DirectoryNameAsMain = require('webpack-directory-name-as-main');\nvar webpackConfig = {\n  entry: ...,\n\n  plugins: [\n    new webpack.ResolverPlugin([\n      new DirectoryNameAsMain()\n    ]),\n    ...\n  ]\n};\n```",
