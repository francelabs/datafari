--------------------------- DATAFARI ------------------------

Datafari is an open source enterprise search solution enriched with AI. It is the perfect product for anyone who needs to search and analyze its corporate data and documents, both within the content and the metadata. Plus, with its genAI modules, it allows to easily leverage mistral, openai, or local LLMs for your company data.

Available as community (open source) and enterprise (proprietary) edition, Datafari is different from the competition :
- Its open source license is not aggressive, as it uses the Apache v2 license: you are free to do whatever you want with it, you just need to mention that you are using it.
- It combines three renowned Apache projects, namely Cassandra, Solr and ManifoldCF, which gives Datafari a long term vision.
