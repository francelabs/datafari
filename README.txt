--------------------------- DATAFARI 5.1 ------------------------

Datafari is an open source enterprise search solution. It is the perfect product for anyone who needs to search and analyze its corporate data and documents, both within the content and the metadata.

Available as community (open source) and enterprise (proprietary) edition, Datafari is different from the competition :
- Its open source license is not aggressive, as it uses the Apache v2 license: you are free to do whatever you want with it, you just need to mention that you are using it.
- It combines three renowned Apache projects, namely Cassandra, Solr and ManifoldCF, which gives Datafari a long term vision.
- It leverages open distro ELK the reference open source stack to do business intelligence on logs.

I. HOW TO INSTALL DATAFARI :

- At least 20GB on an SSD (recommended)

ii. OVA:
If you don't fancy docker, you can opt for a Virtual Machine, which is fully preconfigured: https://datafari.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DATAFARI/pages/66125825/Quick+Start+Guide
