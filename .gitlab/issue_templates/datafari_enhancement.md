Template to declare an enhancement. 

What is an enhancement: can be an extension/improvement to an existing feature, a new feature or documentation work. Basically whatever is not a bug.

First, please use the label "enhancement" to flag it as such.

You have 4 priorities to choose from: Prio 1 is for critical matters, Prio 2 is for enhancements meant to be pushed within the next 2 releases, Prio 3 is for things that matter but you're not sure when to push it, Prio 4 is for enhancements that have clearly no priority at all at the time of its creation.

You should create one ticket per Datafari version where it will be pushed, and use the linking mechanism to point to the same tickets between different versions. Versions are declared as Milestones in our Gitlab.

You cannot declare Datafari versions impacted by the enhancement as a metadata, so you have to declare it in your description.

Once you have closed the ticket, don't forget to mention as comment the commit.
